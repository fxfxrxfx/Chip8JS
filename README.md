[Chip8 emulator](https://fxfxrxfx.github.io/Chip8JS)

Emulator of an old chip 8 console, developed with Javascript.

Chip8 console has the next keys:
  
  1 | 2 | 3 | C
  
  4 | 5 | 6 | D
  
  7 | 8 | 9 | E
  
  A | 0 | B | F
  
Mapped in this emulator as (By now, someday I'll make it editable):

  1 | 2 | 3 | 4
  
  Q | W | E | R
  
  A | S | D | F
  
  Z | X | C | V
  
I just wanted to learn how do emulators work, and try to get more familiar to low level. Reading, I got that Chip8 was the "Easiest one" to program. Many tutorials/Guides/DOCS was about C/C++, and even Java. It's still in dev, but it's been what a funny challenge.
